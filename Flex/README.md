Flex - The workout app

Description
-----------
Flex is an app for people that love working out but also for people who are hesitant to start working out. In short, Flex is a workout planner app where you can add new exercises and group them up to create workouts. 
The exercises can be added to workouts with a certain rep count or with a certain time to be done in. Moreover you can add the amount of sets for a certain exercise as well as rest between sets and exercises. When a workout is started from the list, the app will bring up the next exercise and give the user a card or box where the user can press a button when the exercise or set is completed. After this the app will automatically bring up the rest timer and the next set or exercise. If the user was not able to complete the set or exercise, they will have another button where they can finish the set and go directly to the rest or a selector for the amount of reps they completed. Data for the different exercises like time, sets, reps or weight will be saved and can later be viewed as a table or as graphs to show the progress they have done.

This will be the app initially. The end goal is to create the Spotify of working out where people can share their favourite workouts like playlists with each other or everyone else. The app could be extended to include a running tracker with a gps device or even external devices like running clocks and pulse meters. Further improvements can be personal challenges with rewards, premium functions where you can buy workout plans from professionals, and standardized workouts that a user can test themselves with (like military/navy physical test)
